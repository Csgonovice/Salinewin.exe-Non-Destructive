Password to unzip the file: .exe

The password is set to prevent Windows from flagging it as riskware. It might still be flagged â€” this is a false positive, and unfortunately, I can't do anything about it.

Make sure the audio and .exe files are in the same folder for it to work properly.

Changelog:

Now uses ctypes for a better effect

Compiled to .exe from Python using auto-py-to-exe

Fixed audio issue

Fixed visual issue

Fixed icon issue
